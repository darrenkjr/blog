I’m a PhD Student at the Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation (MCHRI), interested in Learning Health Systems, Complexity and Tech.\nIn practice, I split my time between:\n\nDeveloping (1) and evaluating tools to streamline evidence synthesis during evidence-based guideline development and;\n\nUnderstanding how best to implement Learning Health Systems as a framework for Healthcare Improvement\n\nIn a previous life, I was a Biomedical Engineer (Materials) by training, but now find myself wearing hats that say things like “Data Analyst”, “Implementation Scientist”, and “Generally tries to be useful at all times”.\nOutside of work, I fall into rabbit holes, run, and lift.\nThis slice of the internet is where I maintain my CV, occasional side projects, musings, and oocassional commentary on my publications."
