G'day! I'm a PhD Student at the [Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation (MCHRI)](https://mchri.org.au/), interested in Learning Health Systems, Complexity and Tech. 

In practice, I split my time between:

*  Developing ([1](https://darrenkjr-automatedcitationsearch.streamlit.app/)) and evaluating tools to streamline evidence synthesis during evidence-based guideline development and;  
*  Understanding how best to implement Learning Health Systems as a [framework](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2021.730021/full) for Healthcare Improvement

In a previous life, I was a Biomedical Engineer (Materials) by training, but now find myself wearing hats that say things like "Data Analyst",  "Implementation Scientist", and "Generally tries to be useful at all times". 

Outside of work, I fall into rabbit holes, run, and lift.

This slice of the internet is where I maintain my CV, occasional side projects, [musings](blog_listing.qmd), and oocassional commentary on my [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Fb86efEAAAAJ&hl=en).
